    "Tsunamis are natural hazards that consist of a large, long wave, or series of waves that originate due to a displacement in the ocean.  Such displacements can be man-made or caused by earthquakes, landslides, volanic activity, and other forces.  Tsunamis, unlike waves that are driven by the wind, move between the surface of the ocean and the ocean floor, making them much more powerful and destructive.  When tsunamis approach land, the speed at which it travels and the volume of water it brings to shore can cause damage to human life, property, resources, and infrastructure, especially when there is little to no warning for people to prepare.\n",
